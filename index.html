<h1>Movement Control Order in 2020</h1>

<p>Since Movement Control Order (MCO) had been used in Malaysia, all roads, supermarkets and parks were empty. This is because government have promise to whom that do not follow MCO, will be punished. It is start in 18 March until 31 March; MCO Phase 1. Then, government had make a decision to extend this order from 1 April to 14 April; MCO Phase 2. Currently, the situation is still the same for Malaysian citizens because MCO will be continue starting from 15 April until 28 April; MCO Phase 3. There are 3 easy steps that I would like to share in avoiding COVID-19.</p>

<h3 style="color: red">3 Steps to avoid COVID-19:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Stay at home.</li>
  <li>Washing hand with frequently and take care of self-hygiene.</li>
  <li>Keep a social distancy of 1 meter among other individual.</li>
</ol> 

<p>My family also need to obey to this order. Athough, this order is to boring for my family including me, it was a wise decision from the goverment. But, MCO gives oppurtunity to my family in spending more time together. I can help my mother in her house chores such as wash the plates, be an assistant chef and sweep some trash. Furthermore, I work together with my family including my mother, father and brother in taking care of our cats, clean the spider web at the ceiling and many more. Apart from that, I also shares some stories with them about gadget, current issues and others.</p>

<p>To add more, I also like to search and read some news about new novel that release in the market. The novel publisher that I frequent choose is Penerbitan Karyaseni. I already have read some novel from this publisher and it was good. Plus, I will give some list of novel that I have read from Penerbitan Karyaseni.</p>

<h3>A list of novel that I have read:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Jika Mawar Pudar Warna</li>
  <li>The Wedding Breaker</li>
  <li>Dia Bukan Bidadari</li>
</ul>

<p>I will share the link for Penerbitan Karyaseni but through Facebook. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Karyaseni/">Visit the Penerbitan Karyaseni</a></p>

<p>In my viewpoint, Movement Control Order (MCO) is good for avoiding COVID-19 from spreading to anyone and at the same time can build good relationship with their family. But, the problem arise from this situation is people have their own reasons to adapt with current days. I believe if all people work together to stop COVID-19, it will success.</p>
